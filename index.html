		<h1>File Format Showdown </h1>	
		<h2> <p style="font-family:verdana">Format Overview</p> </h2>
		<h3>
		<p>The two formats that I compared were MOV and MP4. These formats are video and audio formats. 
			A typical MOV file consist of tracks that holds the data(Stellar Data Recovery).
			The common place you see MOV files in on Apple devices. MP4 files are seen on all other platforms(Stellar Data Recovery).
		</h3>
		<h2> <p style="font-family:verdana">Format History </p> </h2>
		<h3>
			<p>Apple created the MOV file in 2001.
			The MP4 file was also developed not long after by the International Organization for Standardization(Wikipedia). 
			These formats are still in use today but the MOV file will slowly become less popular as Apple moves towards the MP4 format for its devices. 
			The MP4 is an open source (Wikipedia).
		</h3>
		<h2> <p style="font-family:verdana">Compression</p> </h2>
		<h3>
			<p>Both file formats use lossy video compression( Stellar Data Recovery). 
			MP4 is not highly compressed however, it is the most universal form of video format (Wondershare).When comparing the two formats in size, MP4 is a larger file and thus less compressed. 
			The MOV file is more compressed, and thus has a smaller file size. 
		</h3>
		<h2> <p style="font-family:verdana">Similar Formats and Advantages / Disadvantages </p> </h2>
		<h3>
			<p> Similar formats include Quicktime and FLV. 
			MOV is a great choice when you are using an Apple device and it is easy to add metadata to these files (Wondershare).
			MP4 is a great choice all around because it is the most standard way to store video information. 
			In an MP4 you can easily store multiple bits of data at a low bandwidth, which makes it easy to share with different platforms(Stellar Data Recovery). 
			MP4 files will work better on a non-apple device, however MOV will be more compatible with Apple devices. </p>
